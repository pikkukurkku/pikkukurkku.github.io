            <h3>Why do I hike solo?</h3>
            <article>
                <p>I used to hike with a boyfriend. Most of the time I felt like I was chasing the guy. I hiked with a friend from work. She photographed every tree, every mushroom and every stick. We didn't even get out of the woods, and it was time to go home. I hiked with experienced hikers. 
                    We ended up having a heated discussion about gays where hate speech was used. I had to escape. I didn't feel comfortable. Didn't feel safe.</p>
                <p>Years passed. I started longing for meeting the perfect man to go hike in the mountains again. I met him in a bar. Told him about my love for the mountains and how much I missed them. He jumped at the opportunity to woo me and pulled out stories from his archive about all the himalayan peaks he had seen a sunrise on. In reality it turned out he preferred to party and drink Whiskey.</p>
                <p>I was frustrated. I realized my desire for the mountains had been woked up like a dormant volcano. I browsed the map of the alps in search of a place I wanted to go to, regardless of anything.
                Tre Cime di Lavaredo. STUNNING! How do I get there? Can I fly? Then train? Then bus? Ok. Let's do this. That's how my first solo hiking trip came into existence. I would love to share my stories with you on this website.</p>
